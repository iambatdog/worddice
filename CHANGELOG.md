## Unreleased — 2025-09-24

- Cleanup: removed unused `.hidden-on-main` CSS rule and cleaned leftover inline-control comments from `index.html`.
- UI: Consolidated settings into the modal (removed duplicate inline controls).
- Accessibility: focus-visible rules and inert/aria-hidden handling while modal is open.
- Minor: small CSS/HTML cleanup and documentation updates.

- Feature: Add Grade level presets (K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) with Apply/Preview and optional placeholders for missing artwork.
- Feature: Add a Standards mapping table with a dedicated Standards modal and a floating "Content Standards" button to view it without opening Settings.
- Fix: Remove duplicate in-modal Content Standards button and ensure the Standards modal is keyboard-accessible and focus-trapped.
